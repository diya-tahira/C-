Take an integer 2d array of size 3 x 3, read its value from user then print elements of array. After this perform the following tasks. After performing all the task your program should ask user if he wants to continue or not if user enter ‘Y’ or ‘y’ then your program should repeat.
1. Create a function that finds the maximum value in array *Function prototype: int maxarray(int a[][3]); *
2. Create a function that calculates the average of all elements of array *Function prototype: double arrayaverage(int a[][3]);
3. Create a function which calculates and display the sum of individual rows of array *Function prototype: void rowssum(int a[][3]);
  a) If the sum of row is greater than or equals to 100 than print the binary representation of sum with the help of function. *Function prototype: void binary(int num1);
  b) Otherwise print the octal representation of sum with help of a function *Function prototype: void octal(int num1);
4. Create a function which calculates and display the product of individual columns of array *Function prototype: void colproduct(int a[][3]);
5. Create a function which display the diagonal elements of matrix (Diagonal elements are those which have same row and column number e.g. a[1][1], a[2][2] )
 *Function prototype: void diagonal(int a[][3]);
6. Create a function which calculate and display the trace of matrix (trace = sum of diagonal elements. E.g. trace = a[1][1] + a[2][2]+ a[3][3] )
 Function prototype: int trace(int a[][3]);
  a) If trace is less or equals to 100 than check whether trace is prime or not with help of function *Function prototype: bool isprime(int n);
  b) Otherwise read an array of size 5 from user and then print every combination of 2 elements like:   *Function prototype: void comb();
